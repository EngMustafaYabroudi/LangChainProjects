# LangChain Projects
## Chatbot : 
This project is a web application using the "Streamlit" library that showcases a model utilizing the "Langchain" library to interact with the "LLAMA2" API for responding to user queries.
## API :
This project uses the Streamlit library to create an interactive web interface that allows users to request the generation of poems on specific topics using a FastAPI server and the LLAMA2 model. The code makes HTTP requests to the FastAPI server to get responses generated by the AI model.
## Groq :
This project creates a web application using the Streamlit library that leverages Langchain to interact with the Groq and LLAMA2 APIs for document retrieval and question answering.
## RAG : 
This project sets up a pipeline to process a PDF document, split its content into chunks, embed these chunks using a specific model, and then store and query these embeddings using a FAISS vector database.
